# Heart-Classification-UCI

This Machine Learning classification project utilizes various models to predict if a patient has heart disease. Additionally, some data visualization was employed to showcase various attributes and their relationships with one another. This can be found in the heart-DNN.ipynb file.

## Dataset:

The dataset was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). It contained 303 samples; each representing a patient tested. Each patient was classified using 13 (out of the original 76) features. More information can be found in the heart_features.txt file located in the data folder.

## Models:

The following Machine Learning models were used for classification:

- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Deep Neural Network (DNN)

## DISCLAIMER:

This project is meant for illustration purposes only! No attempt should be made to use the data presented and the obtained results for any other purpose.
